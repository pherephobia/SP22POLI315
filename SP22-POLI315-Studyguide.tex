Remember our course objectives:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  As a result of the class, students will be able to:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    have some basic knowledge of the definition of international relations and the different approaches to studying international relations.
  \item
    identify and describe dominant topics and concepts related to international relations.
  \item
    obtain a comprehensive understanding of international relations.
  \item
    sharpen research and critical thinking skills.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Thus, students should:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    know basic concepts to understand the topics in international relations.
  \item
    know existing theories to explain the phenomenon in which scholars in international relations are interested.
  \item
    be able to apply the existing theories to different contexts.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{international-cooperation-and-laws}{%
\section{International Cooperation and Laws}\label{international-cooperation-and-laws}}

\hypertarget{international-cooperation}{%
\subsection{International cooperation}\label{international-cooperation}}

Actors mutually adjust their behavior to accommodate the actual or anticipated preferences of others in the pursuit of common goals. Their preferences are not identical and irreconcilable. International cooperation exists when states adopt behavior consistent with the preferences of other states to achieve common objectives like avoiding war, reconciling trade imbalances, or stopping the proliferation of cybercrime.

\hypertarget{what-makes-cooperation-difficult}{%
\subsection{What makes cooperation difficult?}\label{what-makes-cooperation-difficult}}

\hypertarget{relative-gains}{%
\subsubsection{Relative gains}\label{relative-gains}}

Refers to how much more one state gains over another from a given interaction.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The benefits of cooperation are unlikely to be evenly distributed among participating states.
\item
  States can be hesitant to cooperate when one side reaps larger benefits of cooperation.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{prisoners-dilemma}{%
\subsubsection{Prisoner's dilemma}\label{prisoners-dilemma}}

Cooperation is a risky maneuver in the face of the potential for cheating by others.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Knowing that the incentive to cheat exists, each side is driven away from the choice to cooperate.
\item
  Anarchy forces states to make choices based solely on their self-interests, making cooperation very difficult.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{example}{%
\paragraph{Example}\label{example}}

Adam and Bob have robbed a bank and been arrested.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  They are interrogated separately.
\item
  Adam and Bob have the option

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \item
    to confess (move \texttt{C}) or
  \item
    to remain silent (move \texttt{S}).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

The police have little evidence, and if both remain silent they will be sentenced to one year on a minor charge. Therefore the police interrogators propose a deal:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If one confesses while the other remains silent, the one confessing goes free while the other is sentenced to three years.
\item
  However, if both talk, both will still be sentenced to two years.
\end{itemize}

In this game, if each player's payoff is 3 minus the number of years served in jail, we get the following payoff bimatrix.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{10em}|>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{10em}|>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{10em}}
\hline
  & S & C\\
\hline
.bold[S] & 2, 2 & 0, 3\\
\hline
.bold[C] & 3, 0 & 1, 1\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

It seems obvious that both should remain silent, but that's not likely to happen.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Each player's move \texttt{C} strictly dominates move \texttt{S}.
\item
  Furthermore, the best response to move S is \texttt{C}, and the best response to move \texttt{C} is also move \texttt{C}, therefore the pair (\texttt{C}, \texttt{C})---both confessing forms the unique .bold{[}Nash equilibrium{]} of this game.
\item
  The choice \texttt{C} ---confessing---with payoffs of only 1 may seem counterintuitive if negotiations can take place in advance, but their terms are non-binding and cannot be enforced.
\item
  It would be useless to agree on move \texttt{S} in advance, since each of the players would feel a strong urge to deviate (cheat). Only if binding agreements are possible, would both agree on the \texttt{S}-\texttt{S} combination, reaching a higher payoff.
\end{itemize}

Thus \textbf{PRISONER'S DILEMMA} gives a paradoxical result.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Players will play moves that result in lower payoffs for both than are possible.
\item
  This is in part because the rules of the game do not allow binding agreements.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{why-do-some-believe-international-cooperation-is-likely}{%
\subsection{Why do some believe international cooperation is likely?}\label{why-do-some-believe-international-cooperation-is-likely}}

Despite systemic anarchy, states often cooperate because cooperation may be in their self-interest.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  States interact continuously and can reciprocate both cooperation and cheating.
\item
  The expectation of reciprocity makes cooperation a rational choice.
\item
  Shadow of the future: states expect that they will have repeated interactions.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For example, the United States--Mexico--Canada trade agreement creates expectations of consistent future interactions.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

If the prisoner's dilemma is played only once, it is in each prisoner's self-interest to defect. However, if the prisoner's dilemma interaction is played repeatedly, the likelihood of reciprocity (referred to as a tit-for-tat strategy) makes it rational for each prisoner to cooperate rather than defect.

\hypertarget{solution-as-international-institution}{%
\subsubsection{Solution as international institution?}\label{solution-as-international-institution}}

International institutions foster cooperation by encouraging reciprocity.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Institutions make cooperative and non-cooperative behavior easier to identify.
\item
  Institutions can provide states with information about the behavior of others.
\item
  Institutions enable states to align their expectations about what cooperative behavior looks like.
\end{itemize}

Neoliberal institutionalist suggests institutions as a way to prevent states from cheating

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Setting standards of behavior: Establishing rules explicitly through charters or over time through norms
\item
  Verifying compliance: Monitoring (elections, production of nuclear material)
\item
  Reducing costs of joint decision making: Requires institutions to `stick'
\item
  Resolving Disputes: Resolution mechanisms (WTO, Regional Trade Agreements)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{international-laws}{%
\subsection{International Laws}\label{international-laws}}

Consists of a body of rules and norms regulating interactions among states, between states and IGOs, and in more limited cases, among IGOs, states, and individuals. Sources of international law include followings:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Customs---ingrained habits, usually created by groups of states or a hegemon.
\item
  Treaties---binding written agreements that lay out rights and obligations: Usually require ratification.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Treaties are crucial in establishing law across all areas of the international system.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Enforcement Mechanisms and State Compliance

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    States are sovereign actors, and compliance with international law is clearly not absolute.
  \item
    The U.S. invasion of Iraq (2003) violated the UN Charter.
  \item
    Yet, most of the time, states do comply with international law.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{vertical-enforcement}{%
\subsubsection{Vertical Enforcement}\label{vertical-enforcement}}

A legal process whereby one actor works to constrain the actions of another actor over which it has authority in order to secure its compliance with the law.

\hypertarget{horizontal-enforcement}{%
\subsubsection{Horizontal Enforcement}\label{horizontal-enforcement}}

States work to elicit compliance with international law by other states.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Power: States comply with international law because more powerful states make them.
\item
  Reciprocity/tit for tat: the desire to reap the gains of cooperation will incentivize states to comply with the laws.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{intergovernmental-organizations}{%
\section{Intergovernmental Organizations}\label{intergovernmental-organizations}}

International institutions established by states and whose members are the governments of states.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Examples: the United Nations, OPEC, the European Union, etc.
\end{itemize}

Why do states organize themselves collectively through intergovernmental organizations?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Neoliberal institutionalism: Continuous interaction among states provides motivation for them to create international organizations, which, in turn:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Moderate state behavior.
  \item
    Provide a framework for interaction.
  \item
    Establish mechanisms to reduce cheating.
  \item
    Facilitate transparency of state actions.
  \item
    When states repeatedly interact with one another, they can reciprocate cooperative actions or punish non-cooperative ones.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      International institutions help to solidify these repeated interactions by creating lasting relationships among states.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Particularly useful for solving two types of problems:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Technical, nonpolitical issues for which states are not the best units for problem resolution (functionalism)
    \item
      Management of collective goods: goods available to all group members, regardless of individual contribution
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{roles-of-igos-the-international-system}{%
\subsection{Roles of IGOs: The International System}\label{roles-of-igos-the-international-system}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Contribute to habits of cooperation (European Union)
\item
  Gather information; surveillance (International Atomic Energy Agency)
\item
  Settle disputes (World Trade Organization)
\item
  Conduct operational activities (World Food Programme)
\item
  Arena for bargaining (World Trade Organization)
\item
  Lead to creation of transnational societal networks (European Union)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{roles-of-igos-states}{%
\subsection{Roles of IGOs: States}\label{roles-of-igos-states}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Expand the possibilities for foreign policy making
\item
  Used by states as instrument of foreign policy: legitimize foreign policy
\item
  Enhance available information
\item
  Punish or constrain state behavior
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-united-nations}{%
\subsection{The United Nations}\label{the-united-nations}}

Founded as the League of Nations after World War I to focus on the notion of collective security. Guided by three principles:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Each state is legally the equivalent of every other state.
\item
  Only international problems fall within the jurisdiction of the United Nations.
\item
  The United Nations is designed primarily to maintain international peace and security.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{security-council}{%
\subsubsection{Security Council}\label{security-council}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Permanent members (5): the United States, Great Britain, France, Russia, and the People's Republic of China
\item
  Have the ability to veto substantive resolutions passed by the council and ten additional rotating members elected by region.
\item
  Under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, the Security Council has the power to authorize economic sanctions or the use of force against a state that violates international peace and security.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{general-assembly}{%
\subsubsection{General Assembly}\label{general-assembly}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Forum for states to air ideas and complaints from constituents
\item
  Arena in which member states can debate
\item
  Evaluates and approves the UN budget
\item
  Resolutions can provide the basis for new international laws.
\end{itemize}

Limited influence because the General Assembly can make only recommendations and members have widely diverse interests.

\hypertarget{key-political-issues-for-the-united-nations}{%
\subsubsection{Key Political Issues for the United Nations}\label{key-political-issues-for-the-united-nations}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Development of peacekeeping

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Evolved as a way to limit conflict and prevent escalation into Cold War confrontation
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Post--Cold War Chapter VII enforcement
\item
  Continuous efforts to reform
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{traditional-peacekeeping}{%
\subsubsection{Traditional Peacekeeping}\label{traditional-peacekeeping}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Uses third-party military forces drawn from nonpermanent members of the Security Council
\item
  Prevents conflicts from escalating
\item
  Invited in by disputants
\item
  Focuses on separating warring parties (buffer zone), securing borders, patrolling demarcation, maintaining cease-fires
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{complex-peacekeeping}{%
\subsection{Complex Peacekeeping}\label{complex-peacekeeping}}

Also known as multidimensional peacekeeping:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Respond to civil wars, ethnonational conflicts, and domestic unrest
\item
  Disputants may not have requested UN assistance
\item
  Use of military and civilian personnel (including those drawn from the Security Council)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Verifying troop withdrawals
  \item
    Separating warring factions
  \item
    Conducting and supervising elections
  \item
    Implementing human rights guarantees
  \item
    Supplying humanitarian aid
  \item
    Helping civil administration maintain law and order (also known as peacebuilding)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{nongovernmental-organizations-ngos}{%
\subsection{Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs)}\label{nongovernmental-organizations-ngos}}

Private, voluntary organizations whose members are individuals or associations that come together to address a common purpose, often oriented to a public good.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Not sovereign; lack resources available to states.
\item
  Some entirely private, and some partially relying on government aid.
\item
  Some are open to mass membership; others are closed-member groups.
\item
  The number of NGOs has grown dramatically.
\end{itemize}

In recent decades, NGOs have grown in importance due to the communications revolution (fax, internet, e-mail, social media) recruit to, and launch the publicity campaigns of many NGOs.

\hypertarget{functions-and-roles-of-ngos}{%
\subsubsection{Functions and Roles of NGOs}\label{functions-and-roles-of-ngos}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Advocate for specific policies
\item
  Alternative channel for political participation
\item
  Mobilize mass publics
\item
  Distribute aid
\item
  Monitor norms and state practices
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-power-of-ngos}{%
\subsubsection{The Power of NGOs}\label{the-power-of-ngos}}

NGOs rely on soft power, trying to persuade others to change their behavior. Having an independent donor base and links with grassroots groups provides flexibility of actions.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Can operate in different areas of the world
\end{itemize}

Being politically independent allows for rapid and direct execution of policy initiatives.

\hypertarget{the-limits-of-ngos}{%
\subsubsection{The Limits of NGOs}\label{the-limits-of-ngos}}

NGOs often lack material forms of power; they cannot command obedience through physical means. Most NGOs have very limited funding. Many NGOs rely on governments, which raises questions of legitimacy and neutrality.

\hypertarget{what-are-the-human-rights}{%
\section{What Are the Human Rights?}\label{what-are-the-human-rights}}

Each one of us no matter who we are or where we are born is entitled to the same basic rights and freedoms.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Human rights are not privileges.
\item
  Human rights cannot be granted or revoked.
\item
  Human rights inalienable and universal.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{political-and-civil-human-rights}{%
\subsection{Political and civil human rights}\label{political-and-civil-human-rights}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Rights that states cannot take away (free speech, assembly)
\item
  Freedom of speech and assembly, security, and protection of the press
\item
  No individual should be deprived of these rights.
\item
  Enshrined in historical documents, such as

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The Magna Carta, 1215
  \item
    The French Declaration of the Rights of Man, 1789
  \item
    U.S. Bill of Rights, 1791
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{economic-and-social-human-rights}{%

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Rights that states should provide (health care, jobs)
\item
  Decent education, work, health care, and standard of living
\item
  Rights with a focus on ``the material''
\item
  Heavily influenced by Karl Marx's writings and critical social theorists

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Socialist theorists believe that without these guarantees of socioeconomic rights, political and civil rights are meaningless.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{collective-rights}{%
\subsection{Collective rights}\label{collective-rights}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The rights of the marginalized
\item
  The idea of collective rights is not nearly as universal as these rights are contested within states.
\item
  Broad spectrum of rights that states should provide to minorities and the historically marginalized as well as to the collective:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Consist of rights for refugees, ethnic minorities, women, indigenous peoples, and LGBTQ+ individuals
  \item
    Include the right to development and the right to a clean environment
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Highly contested in states and the international arena
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{human-rights-as-emerging-international-responsibility}{%
\section{Human Rights as Emerging International Responsibility}\label{human-rights-as-emerging-international-responsibility}}

Geneva Conventions form the core of international humanitarian law.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  I: protection of the wounded in the armed forces (1864)
\item
  II: protection of the wounded at sea (1906)
\item
  III: protection of prisoners of war (1929)
\item
  \textbf{IV: protection of noncombatants during wartime (1949)}
\end{itemize}

Geneva Conventions form the core of international humanitarian law. Slow evolution (almost 80 years!) of human rights until World War II. Contrary to popular belief, the Geneva Conventions do not prohibit the use of weapons of mass destruction. Because the Geneva Conventions are concerned with the protection of human rights. The Hague Convention and the Geneva Protocol govern weapons of mass destruction (related to biological and chemical weapons).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A statement of human rights aspirations; Though not legally binding, the statement identified 30 human rights principles covering both political and economic rights.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Two legally binding documents

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights
  \item
    The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
  \end{itemize}
\item
  These three documents are known as the International Bill of Rights.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{two-faced-states-states-as-protectors-of-human-rights}{%
\subsection{Two-faced States: States as Protectors of Human Rights}\label{two-faced-states-states-as-protectors-of-human-rights}}

Westphalian tradition suggests that states are primarily responsible for protecting human rights standards within their own jurisdiction. Many liberal democratic states support political and civil rights in their foreign policy. Using diplomacy by tying certain benefits to improvements in human rights.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Offering trade concessions or increased aid
\item
  Punishing through sanctions
\item
  Example studied: Kim and Kroeger (2017) Rewarding the introduction of multiparty elections. \emph{EJPE}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{two-faced-states-states-as-abusers-of-human-rights}{%
\subsection{Two-faced States: States as Abusers of Human Rights}\label{two-faced-states-states-as-abusers-of-human-rights}}

Authoritarian or autocratic states are more likely to abuse political and civil rights. Less developed states may be unable or unwilling to meet basic obligations of social and economic rights due to scarce resources or lack of political will. State security often prevails over individual rights. Political-civil rights may be repressed in times of economic strife to divert attention from the economy. Culture and history affect a state's human rights record.

\hypertarget{the-role-of-the-international-communityigos-and-ngos}{%
\section{The Role of the International Community---IGOs and NGOs}\label{the-role-of-the-international-communityigos-and-ngos}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Set human rights standards (United Nations)
\item
  Monitor standards
\item
  Establish complaint procedures
\item
  Compile reports on state behavior
\item
  Investigate alleged violations
\end{itemize}

IGOs may, at times, respond to egregious humanitarian emergencies (United Nations, states).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In a few cases, states may use IGOs to respond to egregious humanitarian emergencies.
\item
  So-called humanitarian intervention was used in the crisis in Somalia in 1992.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{naming-and-shaming}{%
\subsection{Naming and shaming}\label{naming-and-shaming}}

Publicly identifying and stigmatizing the non-compliant actors

\begin{itemize}
\item
  NGO's weapon against repressive regimes
\item
  State - primarily targets or supporters of naming and shaming (passive roles)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{enforcement-problems}{%
\subsection{Enforcement Problems}\label{enforcement-problems}}

A state's signature on treaties is no guarantee of its willingness or ability to enforce treaty provisions. Monitoring via self-reporting presumes a willingness to comply and be transparent. NGOs play a key role in monitoring. Economic embargoes may not achieve changes in human rights policy and may hurt those whom embargoes are intended to help. Military action may cause unintended casualties.

Does monitoring by IGOs or NGOs through investigations, reports, resolutions, and naming and shaming ultimately make a difference for rights protection? The evidence is mixed. One study of over 400 human rights organizations on shaming governments between 1992 and 2004 found that states targeted by NGOs do improve their human rights practices. But shaming is not enough. Shaming is effective when both domestic NGOs on the ground and advocacy by other third parties and individuals are present.

\section{Article: BDM et al.~(2005) Thinking Inside the Box}\label{article-bdm-et-al.-2005-thinking-inside-the-box}}

BDM et al.~(2005) argues that a gradual, continuous democratization process does not lead to a gradual improvement of human rights. Some aspects of democratization process generate higher level of human rights protection. Thus, BDM et al.~(2005) expects that increasing degrees of democracy do not lead smoothly to improved human rights; rather, it depends on the mix of scores on the various dimensions that compose a particular scale. Democracy is reliable as a means of reducing human rights abuses only when institutional reforms pass thresholds that ensure accountability, thereby translating institutional changes into behavioral changes. BDM et al.~(2005) finds that democratization does not yield significant improvements for human rights until party competition is normalized. Human rights improvements reflect the discontinuous function of democratization. They conclude that multiparty competition is more significant than other dimensions to reduce human rights abuses. Increases at a state level of democracy do not generate greater respect for human rights. Fully democratization significantly improves human rights record.

Resource limitation led organizations to adopt issues that can earn much attention. Testing with quantitative text analysis, previously identified distinct latent topics may combine together as they being discussed together by human rights organizations. Park et al.~(2019) concludes that human rights issues evolve over time and shows that human rights issues are interdependent with each other and co-evolve over time.

\section{The Role of States}\label{the-role-of-states}}

States can use a variety of tools to influence domestic and international economic policy.

Macroeconomic polices

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Fiscal policies: affect state budgets by setting spending levels and tax rates
\item
  Monetary policies: control the money supply
\end{itemize}

Microeconomics policies: policies on regulation, subsidies, competition, and antitrust actions

\textbf{Exchange rates}: the price of currency in relation to another (floating/fixed rates)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The International Classical Gold Standard (gold coin standard), 1873-1914

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The gold standard became the basis for the international monetary system after 1873.
  \item
    Adopting and maintaining a singular monetary arrangement encouraged international trade and investment by stabilizing international price relationships and facilitating foreign borrowing.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Moved to gold bullion standard (1931)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    When a large amount of money was required as a result of World War I, countries temporarily stopped converting gold and began to increase the issuance of money.
  \item
    This was a major setback for the gold standard.
  \item
    Furthermore, the gold standard system based on the nine pound collapsed decisively with the onset of the Great Depression.
  \item
    After the WWII, the Bretton Woods system was established after it was decided to adopt the gold standard with the US dollar as the reserve currency.
  \item
    The crucial difference between the classical gold standard system and the modern gold standard system is that the United States exclusively performs gold conversion, rather than each country's central banks performing gold conversion independently.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Moved to floating exchange rate: Nixon shock (1971)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    US issues too much dollars for the Cold War and Vietnamese war, regardless of the amount of Gold that US has.
  \item
    Other countries required US to convert their dollars into golds.
  \item
    1971, Nixon supported suspending the dollar's convertibility into gold.
  \item
    The Nixon Shock effectively led to the end of the Bretton Woods Agreement and the convertibility of U.S. dollars into gold.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Trade policies

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Tariffs}: taxes on goods and services crossing borders
\item
  \textbf{Nontariff barriers}: restrictions on international trade designed to protect health, safety, or national security
\item
  \textbf{Current accounts}: measure the net border flows between countries of goods, services, government transfers, and income on capital investments
\item
  \textbf{Capital accounts}: describe the flows of capital between countries, including foreign direct investment and portfolio investment in and out
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Balance of payments}: a country's current and capital account balances

  \texttt{Milnter\ (1999)}: One of the most salient changes in the world economy since 1980 has been the move toward \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ among countries across the globe. How do existing theories about trade policy explain this puzzle? Three sets of explanations are prominent. First, many focus on changes in trade policy preferences among \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, either societal groups or political leaders. Second, scholars examine changes in political institutions to account for such policy change. Third, they seek explanations in changes in the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Large-scale changes in political institutions, especially in the direction of democracy, may be necessary for the kind of massive trade liberalization that has occurred. But changes in preferences cannot be overlooked in explaining the rush to free trade. Moreover, the influence of international institutions has been important. Finally, the reciprocal impact of trade on domestic politics and the international political system is important. If the rush to free trade is sustained, will its impact be benign or malign?

  A. freer trade; international actors; domestic political system

  B. more protectionist trade; domestic actors; domestic political system

  C. freer trade; domestic actors; international political system

  D. freer trade; transnational actors; domestic political system
\item
  \texttt{Bueno\ de\ Mesquita\ et\ al.\ (2005)}: Research on human rights consistently points to the importance of democracy in reducing the severity and incidence of personal integrity abuses. The prescriptive implications of this finding for policy makers interested in state building have been somewhat limited, however, by a reliance on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of democracy. Consequently, a policy maker emerges from this literature confident that ``democracy matters'' but unclear about which set(s) of reforms is likely to yield a greater human rights payoff. Using data from the Polity IV Project, we examine what aspects of democracy are most consequential in improving a state's human rights record. Analysis of democracy's dimensions elicits three findings. First, political participation at the level of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ appears more significant than other dimensions in reducing human rights abuses. Second, improvements in a state's level of democracy short of full democracy do not promote greater respect for integrity rights. Only those states with the highest levels of democracy, not simply those conventionally defined as democratic, are correlated with better human rights practices. Third, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ appears to be the critical feature that makes full-fledged democracies respect human rights; limited accountability generally retards improvement in human rights.

  A. multidimensional measures; unconventional political arena; accountability

  B. unidimensional measures; multiparty competition; contestation

  C. unidimensional measures; unconventional political arena; accountability

  D. multidimensional measures; multiparty competition; contestation
\item
  \texttt{Green\ and\ Hale\ (2017)}: Despite the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ urgency of many environmental problems, environmental politics remains at the margins of the discipline. Using data from the Teaching, Research, and International Policy (TRIP) project, this article identifies a puzzle: the majority of international relations (IR) scholars find \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ among the top three most important policy issues today, yet fewer than 4\% identify the environment as their primary area of research. Moreover, environmental research is rarely published in top IR journals, although there has been a recent surge in work focused on climate change. The authors argue that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ attention to environmental issues---including those beyond climate change---in IR can bring significant benefits to the discipline, and they discuss three lines of research to correct this imbalance.

  A. increasing; greater; climate change

  B. increasing; less; economic growth

  C. decreasing; greater; climate change

  D. decreasing; less; economic growth

Most economists have argued for many years that reducing barriers to international trade, often referred to as ``globalization,'' can in principle make everyone better off because of the theory of comparative advantage. These economists maintain that the world economy has grown over the last two decades due to globalization. Yet there has been a political backlash against globalization in many countries. What is the theory of comparative advantage and how does it work? Why has there been a backlash against globalization? According to the Stolper-Samuelson theory, which people in the US should be most opposed to globalization, and which people in India should be most opposed to globalization?
