27. `Milner (1999)`: One of the most salient changes in the world economy since 1980 has been the move toward __________ among countries across the globe. How do existing theories about trade policy explain this puzzle? Three sets of explanations are prominent. First, many focus on changes in trade policy preferences among __________, either societal groups or political leaders. Second, scholars examine changes in political institutions to account for such policy change. Third, they seek explanations in changes in the ______________________________. Large-scale changes in political institutions, especially in the direction of democracy, may be necessary for the kind of massive trade liberalization that has occurred. But changes in preferences cannot be overlooked in explaining the rush to free trade. Moreover, the influence of international institutions has been important. Finally, the reciprocal impact of trade on domestic politics and the international political system is important. If the rush to free trade is sustained, will its impact be benign or malign?

    A. freer trade; international actors; domestic political system
    
    B. more protectionist trade; domestic actors; domestic political system
    
    C. freer trade; domestic actors; international political system
    
    D. freer trade; transnational actors; domestic political system

28. `Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2005)`: Research on human rights consistently points to the importance of democracy in reducing the severity and incidence of personal integrity abuses. The prescriptive implications of this finding for policy makers interested in state building have been somewhat limited, however, by a reliance on ____________________  of democracy. Consequently, a policy maker emerges from this literature confident that "democracy matters" but unclear about which set(s) of reforms is likely to yield a greater human rights payoff. Using data from the Polity IV Project, we examine what aspects of democracy are most consequential in improving a state's human rights record. Analysis of democracy's dimensions elicits three findings. First, political participation at the level of ____________________ appears more significant than other dimensions in reducing human rights abuses. Second, improvements in a state's level of democracy short of full democracy do not promote greater respect for integrity rights. Only those states with the highest levels of democracy, not simply those conventionally defined as democratic, are correlated with better human rights practices. Third, ________________ appears to be the critical feature that makes full-fledged democracies respect human rights; limited accountability generally retards improvement in human rights.

    A. multidimensional measures; unconventional political arena; accountability
    
    B. unidimensional measures; multiparty competition; contestation
    
    C. unidimensional measures; unconventional political arena; contestation
    
    D. multidimensional measures; multiparty competition; accountability
    
29. `Green and Hale (2017)`: Despite the ___________ urgency of many environmental problems, environmental politics remains at the margins of the discipline. Using data from the Teaching, Research, and International Policy (TRIP) project, this article identifies a puzzle: the majority of international relations (IR) scholars find ___________ among the top three most important policy issues today, yet fewer than 4% identify the environment as their primary area of research. Moreover, environmental research is rarely published in top IR journals, although there has been a recent surge in work focused on climate change. The authors argue that ___________ attention to environmental issues—including those beyond climate change—in IR can bring significant benefits to the discipline, and they discuss three lines of research to correct this imbalance.

    A. increasing; climate change; greater

    B. increasing; economic growth; less

    C. decreasing; climate change; greater

    D. decreasing; economic growth; less

Most economists have argued for many years that reducing barriers to international trade, often referred to as “globalization,” can in principle make everyone better off because of the theory of comparative advantage.

What is the theory of comparative advantage and how does it work? Why has there been a backlash against globalization?
