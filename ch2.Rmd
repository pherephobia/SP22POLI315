# The Historical Context of Contemporary International Relations

Why do we care about history? It is because history explains the origins of key concepts in international relations such as sovereignty, the international state system, colonialism, and power distribution among states. Throughout modern history, four distinct changing movements have occurred: democratization, modernization, secularization, and globalization.

+ Democratization: Many states in modern history have experienced regime transitions from authoritarian to democratic. Samuel Huntington, for example, refers to the three major regime transition movements as "waves."

+ Modernization: It encompasses various aspects of societal development, including education, economic growth, and human rights.

+ Secularization: The political power of the church no longer trumps the political power of the states. After a 30-year war, kings were free of the Pope.

+ Globalization: The world's increasing integration in terms of politics, economics, and culture. Financial markets are intertwined, and states are culturally homogenizing.
