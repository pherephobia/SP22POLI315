Makeup mid-term exams will be allowed only with pre-approval of the instructor or with an acceptable, documented reason. Acceptable reasons for makeup exams include severe illness, family emergencies or other unavoidable events including dangerous weather conditions and car accidents. Exam format for makeup exams may be different from the original exam and will likely utilize a short answer format. An oral examination may also be utilized if deemed appropriate by the instructor.

Remember our course objectives:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  As a result of the class, students will be able to:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    have some basic knowledge of the definition of international relations and the different approaches to studying international relations.
  \item
    identify and describe dominant topics and concepts related to international relations.
  \item
    obtain a comprehensive understanding of international relations.
  \item
    sharpen research and critical thinking skills.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Thus, students should:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    know basic concepts to understand the topics in international relations.
  \item
    know existing theories to explain the phenomenon in which scholars in international relations are interested.
  \item
    be able to apply the existing theories to different contexts.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{interaction-between-political-units-in-world-politics}{%
\section{Interaction between political units in world politics}\label{interaction-between-political-units-in-world-politics}}

Classically the interaction between countries. But its much more than that. \textbf{International Relations}, a subfield of political science, studies \textbf{interactions among the various actors that participate in international politics}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Politically, states are confronted with issues like disease, migration, and environmental degradation that governments cannot manage on their own: War, alliances
\item
  Economically, states' financial markets are tied together; the internationalization of production makes it more difficult for states to regulate their own economic policies and causes them to be more affected by international forces: Trade, investment, aid
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Globalization} is the growing integration of the world in terms of politics, economics, and culture. Financial markets are tied together and states are experiencing cultural homogenization.

\textbf{IR} also studies political phenomena beyond the scope of countries, such as financial crises, human rights, United Nations, WTO, Regional \& Global Events.

\hypertarget{social-science}{%
\section{Social science}\label{social-science}}

For establishing scientific knowledge, we should answer two questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  On questions of fact: scientific facts should be \textbf{empirical} and \textbf{reproducible}.
\item
  On question of theory: scientific knowledge must be \textbf{explanatory} and \textbf{testable}.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{social-science-and-international-relations}{%
\section{Social science and International Relations}\label{social-science-and-international-relations}}

Political scientists develop theories to understand the causes of events that occur in international relations.

Key theories are

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Realism and neorealism
\item
  Liberalism and neoliberal institutionalism
\item
  Constructivism
\end{itemize}

These theories help us describe, explain, and predict. Suppose a theory has a following structure: \texttt{X} (cause) causes \texttt{Y} (outcome) under \texttt{C} (conditions).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  To evaluate the theory, we should \textbf{describe} what \texttt{X}, \texttt{Y} and \texttt{C}.
\item
  When we know what \texttt{X} and \texttt{C} are, we can \textbf{predict} \texttt{Y} with the theory.
\item
  When we know what \texttt{Y} is and the theory, we can \textbf{explain} what causes \texttt{Y}.
\item
  \textbf{Conditions}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Spatial: For example, U.S., Latin America, East Asia, or Africa
  \item
    Temporal: After the Cold War, during the Great Depression, under the Pandemic
  \item
    Other factors: The Effect of \texttt{X} on \texttt{Y} can be conditional on \texttt{C}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

To assess the accuracy, relevancy, and potency of their theories, scholars of international relations rely on history, philosophy, and scientific method.

Much of classical philosophy focuses on the state and its leaders---the basic building blocks of international relations.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Hobbes: society can escape from the state of nature through a unitary state with centralized power.
\item
  Rousseau: small communities, in which the general will can be attained, lead to the fulfillment of the individual's self-interests.
\item
  Kant: a federation of sovereign republics bound by the rule of law is a means to peace.
\end{itemize}

Philosophy helps us speculate on the \textbf{normative} (or moral) elements of political life. Normative questions are the ``should questions.'' However, scholars experienced several failure to explain global events, such as World Wars and ask a question if such normative theories are sufficient. Thus, the scientific method of behavioralism emerged, proposing that individuals, both alone and in groups, act in patterned ways.

\hypertarget{behaviorism}{%
\subsection{Behaviorism}\label{behaviorism}}

\hypertarget{description}{%
\subsubsection{Description}\label{description}}

Behavioralism proposes that individuals, both alone and in groups, act in patterned ways, believing that generalizable patterns may be found. It suggests plausible hypotheses regarding those patterned actions, and empirically tests those hypotheses.

\hypertarget{significance}{%
\subsubsection{Significance}\label{significance}}

fter introducing the Behavioralism, political scientists moved from the should questions to why questions. It led to paradigm shifts in terms of methods in IR, Political Science, and even Social Science.

\hypertarget{the-historical-context-of-contemporary-international-relations}{%
\chapter{The Historical Context of Contemporary International Relations}\label{the-historical-context-of-contemporary-international-relations}}

Why do we care about history? It is because history explains the origins of key concepts in international relations such as sovereignty, the international state system, colonialism, and power distribution among states. Throughout modern history, four distinct changing movements have occurred: democratization, modernization, secularization, and globalization.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Democratization: Many states in modern history have experienced regime transitions from authoritarian to democratic. Samuel Huntington, for example, refers to the three major regime transition movements as ``waves.''
\item
  Modernization: It encompasses various aspects of societal development, including education, economic growth, and human rights.
\item
  Secularization: The political power of the church no longer trumps the political power of the states. After a 30-year war, kings were free of the Pope.
\item
  Globalization: The world's increasing integration in terms of politics, economics, and culture. Financial markets are intertwined, and states are culturally homogenizing.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{description-1}{%
\subsubsection{Description}\label{description-1}}

A religious dispute between Catholics and Protestants. It began when Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II of Bohemia attempted to curtail the religious activities of his subjects, sparking rebellion among Protestants.

\hypertarget{significance-1}{%
\subsubsection{Significance}\label{significance-1}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Most international relations theorists locate the origins of the contemporary state system in Europe in 1648, the year the Treaties of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years' War.
\item
  These treaties marked the end of rule by religious authority in Europe
  and the emergence of secular authorities. With secular authority came the principle that has provided the foundation for contemporary international relations: the notion of the territorial integrity of states.
\end{itemize}

Napoleon led large, well-armed, and passionately motivated armies to conquer the entire Europe.

\hypertarget{significance-2}{%

\hypertarget{description-3}{%
\subsubsection{Description}\label{description-3}}

General consensus among the Great Powers to maintain the European balance of power and the integrity of territorial boundaries.

\hypertarget{significance-3}{%
\subsubsection{Significance}\label{significance-3}}

The concert of Europe made the balance of power be rule of thumb for the European countries for their foreign policy goals.

\hypertarget{solidification-of-alliances-and-world-war-i}{%
\subsection{Solidification of Alliances and World War I}\label{solidification-of-alliances-and-world-war-i}}

Whereas in most of the nineteenth century, alliances had been flexible and fluid, by the later years, alliances became more rigid. The balance of power broke down due to these solidifications of alliances, resulting in World War I.

\hypertarget{world-war-ii}{%
\subsection{World War II}\label{world-war-ii}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Hitler and the \textbf{Third Reich}: Fascism as practiced by Hitler effectively mobilized the masses in support of the state, exalting the nation and race above the individual. It capitalized on the idea that war and conflict were noble activities from which ultimately superior civilizations would be formed.
\item
  The rise of Mussolini and fascist Italy
\item
  Brutality of the Axis powers toward noncombatants
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-cold-war}{%
\subsection{The Cold War}\label{the-cold-war}}

After World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union (USSR) emerged as two superpowers. The Cold War describes about 45 years of overall high-level tension and competition between the superpowers but no direct military conflict.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The United States adopted a policy of \textbf{containment}, as opposed to a more aggressive \textbf{rollback} strategy.
\item
  The USSR pushed favored an aggressive rollback strategy, which forces other countries to change their policies.
\end{itemize}

Sovereignty rests with those who have the ultimate right to make political decisions.

\hypertarget{balance-of-power}{%

\hypertarget{description-5}{%
\subsubsection{Description}\label{description-5}}

States with relatively equal power offset concentrations of power to prevent the emergence of hegemonies or hegemonic blocks.

\hypertarget{significance-5}{%
\subsubsection{Significance}\label{significance-5}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  When one state or coalition of states is much more powerful than its adversaries, asymmetrical war is relatively more likely.
\item
  Due to BoP, states considered multipolar system is likely to lead stable international system.

\hypertarget{realism-and-neo-realism}{%
\section{Realism and Neo-realism}\label{realism-and-neo-realism}}

A paradigm based on the premise that world politics is essentially and unchangeably a struggle among self-interested states for power and position under anarchy, with each competing state pursuing its ownnational interests.

\hypertarget{assumptions}{%
\subsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions}}

\emph{Key words}: Anarchy, States, Survival (Security), National interests, Self-help, (Alliances)

\hypertarget{political-realism}{%
\subsection{Political Realism}\label{political-realism}}

Hans Morgenthau

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Just as for Thucydides, Augustine, and Hobbes, international politics is best characterized as a struggle for power: \textbf{international self-help system}
\item
  Power is the most important currency in international politics both to take from others and to prevent the inevitable effort by others to steal.
\item
  Emphasized \textbf{relative gains, security dilemma, power}, and \textbf{diplomacy}.
\item
  Criticism:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Human nature is a constant, not a variable.
  \item
    It is almost impossible to observe innate conflict in men.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{structural-neo--realism}{%
\subsection{Structural (Neo-) Realism}\label{structural-neo--realism}}

Kenneth Waltz's neorealism (or structural realism) proposes structural characteristics of the international system as main explanatory factors. System structure and the distribution of power, rather than the characteristics of states, determine outcomes.

\hypertarget{anarchy}{%
\subsubsection{Anarchy}\label{anarchy}}

\hypertarget{distribution-of-power-polarity-unipolar-bipolar-multipolar}{%
\subsubsection{Distribution of power (polarity): unipolar, bipolar, multipolar}\label{distribution-of-power-polarity-unipolar-bipolar-multipolar}}

\hypertarget{descripton}{%
\paragraph{Descripton}\label{descripton}}

The number of states -- one(unipolar), two(bipolar), three(tripolar), or more(multipolar) -- holding significant power in the international system.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Unipolar, where one state in the system has sufficient power to defeat all the others combined against it.
\item
  Bipolar, where most of the system's power is divided between two states or coalitions of states
\item
  Multipolar, in which power is divided among three or more states or coalitions of states.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{significance-6}{%
\paragraph{Significance}\label{significance-6}}

It describes the nature of the international system at any given period of time.

\hypertarget{power-transition-theory}{%
\subsection{Power Transition Theory}\label{power-transition-theory}}

Does not assume anarchic international system. PTT Focuses on differential growth rates and their effect on altering relative power between nations, resulting in new relationships among nations or competing groups and the formation of new political and economic entities.

\hypertarget{liberalism-and-neo-liberal-institutionalism}{%
\section{Liberalism and Neo-liberal Institutionalism}\label{liberalism-and-neo-liberal-institutionalism}}

A paradigm predicated on the hope that the application of reason and universal ethics to international relations can lead to a more orderly, just, and cooperative world.

\hypertarget{assumptions-1}{%
\subsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions-1}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Do not assume states as unitary actors (state actor \textless{} non-state actor) and `perfectly' rational actors.
\item
  Also, (classical) liberalism reject the impact of anarchic international system.
\item
  Emphasizes interdependence and cooperation among transnational actors (states + non-states)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{liberal-idealism-classical-liberalism}{%
\subsection{Liberal idealism (Classical liberalism)}\label{liberal-idealism-classical-liberalism}}

Advocates creating global institutions to contain the raw struggle for power between self-serving, mutually suspicious states.

\hypertarget{collective-security.}{%
\subsubsection{Collective Security.}\label{collective-security.}}

A security regime agreed to by the great powers that sets rules for keeping peace, guided by the principle that an act of aggression by any state will be met by a collective response from the rest.

\hypertarget{limitations}{%
\subsubsection{Limitations}\label{limitations}}

Classical liberalism overlooked the influence of international anarchic system. Also, it appealed to the human community's moral spirit to solve the problem of cooperation. Furthermore, it does not value the role of the state (state \textless{} individuals). Classical liberalism does not have clear answer for security issue.

\hypertarget{democratic-peace-theory}{%
\subsection{Democratic Peace Theory}\label{democratic-peace-theory}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Democratic political cultures and system avoid lethal force as a means of settling disagreements.
\item
  Conflict-resolution practices used at home (domestically) can also be used when dealing with international disputes.
\item
  eaders socialized within democratic cultures share a common outlook, applying democratic norms (based on tolerance, compromise, and civil liberties) to regulate international competition.
\item
  Diplomacy provides a means for achieving mutually acceptable solutions to a common problem, and enables leaders to negotiate and compromise in a peaceful manner.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Diplomacy: Communication and negotiation between global actors that is not dependent upon the use of force and seeks a cooperative solution
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{neoliberal-institutionalism}{%
\subsection{Neoliberal Institutionalism}\label{neoliberal-institutionalism}}

The ``new'' liberal theoretical perspective that accounts for the way international institutions promote global change, cooperation, peace, and prosperity through collective programs for reforms.

Neoliberal institutionalism share an interest in probing the conditions under which the convergent and overlapping interests among otherwise independent transnational actors may result in \textbf{cooperation}.

\hypertarget{assumptions-2}{%
\subsubsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions-2}}

\textbf{Cooperation} emerges not as a result of humanity's desire for positive change but as a result of self-interest.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  States are unitary rational actors that pursue self-interest.
\item
  Despite the existence of anarchy, interstate cooperation can arise as states focus on absolute gains.
\end{itemize}

Neoliberal institutionalists arrive at the same prediction that other liberals do---cooperation---but their explanation for why cooperation occurs is different.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  International institutions and reciprocity foster \textbf{cooperation}.
\item
  \textbf{Should read Keohane and Martin (1995)!}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{constructivism}{%
\section{Constructivism}\label{constructivism}}

A paradigm based on the premise that world politics is a function of the ways that states construct and then accept images of reality and later respond to the meanings given to power politics.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  State behavior is shaped by elite beliefs, identities, and social norms.
\item
  Individuals forge, shape, and change culture through ideas and practices.
\item
  Interests at all levels are \textbf{socially constructed} via \textbf{constant interaction}.
\item
  National interests are ever-changing and the result of social identities of state actors.
\item
  People and their discourse bring meaning to material structures.
\item
  International organizations can socialize states and individuals to norms.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{wendt-1991}{%
\subsection{Wendt (1991)}\label{wendt-1991}}

The meaning of anarchy can be either conflictual or cooperative, depending on underlying shared knowledge (e.g.~anarchy among allies vs.~anarchy among enemies).

The most important source of conflict between states.

\hypertarget{institutions}{%

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The formal and informal rules that organize social, political and economic relations.
\item
  Set of implicit or explicit principles, norms, rules, and decision-making procedures around which actors' expectations converge.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{significance-8}{%
\subsubsection{Significance}\label{significance-8}}

A key structure that makes states cooperate even under the anarchic system and uncertainties.

\hypertarget{complex-interdependence}{%
\subsection{Complex interdependence}\label{complex-interdependence}}

\hypertarget{description-8}{%
\subsubsection{Description}\label{description-8}}

States are connected through .multiple channels.

\hypertarget{significance-9}{%
\subsubsection{Significance}\label{significance-9}}

As security is not the only concern, when the complex interdependence increases, it is more likely to decline in the use of military force.

\hypertarget{levels-of-analysis-in-international-relations}{%
\chapter{Levels of Analysis in International Relations}\label{levels-of-analysis-in-international-relations}}

It is the direction, or ``level,'' from which the primary cause of events is coming. Understanding where facts are coming from helps us to sort out facts and the origins of causes in highly complex problems (external vs.~internal; systemic, domestic, and individual level).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Dividing the analysis of international politics into levels of analysis helps orient our questions and suggests the appropriate type of evidence to explore.
\item
  We can approach the study of international relations not only by looking through the lenses of the various perspectives but also by highlighting explanatory factors that occur at the different levels of analysis.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{different-levels}{%
\section{Different Levels}\label{different-levels}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  International system level: focuses on systemic characteristics such as power distribution
\item
  State level{]} focuses on domestic factors and internal characteristics of states

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Organizational level: focuses on particular groups or organizations such as firms or interest groups and their choices.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Individual level: focuses on individuals and their perceptions, choices, activities, etc.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{macro-level-holism}{%
\section{Macro level: Holism}\label{macro-level-holism}}

Macro level focuses on systems as a whole rather than individually. It considers that the whole is more than a sum of its parts. However, it has a possible ecological fallacy.

\hypertarget{micro-level-reductionism}{%
\section{Micro level: Reductionism}\label{micro-level-reductionism}}

Micro level can be called methodological individualism (McGaw and Watson, 1976), which argues that the whole is nothing more than a sum of its part. However, micro level analysis also have a possible fallacy of composition.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Disruptive behavior is immediately evident.

  Two sides can moderate each other's use of violence.
\item
  They can absorb potentially destabilizing changes.
\item
  Each focuses its activity on just the other.

\subsection{Some theorists believe that multipolarity can be quite stable.}\label{some-theorists-believe-that-multipolarity-can-be-quite-stable.}}

The success of multipolarity depends on whether rules are followed. When an essential actor ignores the understood rules, the system may become unstable.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  There are more interactions and less opportunity to dwell on one state.
\item
  There is a greater flexibility of responses to threats.
\item
  Shifting alliances allow for flexibility and enhance a balance of power.
\item
  Wars are limited in nature and designed to preserve a balance of power.
