How to study Remember our course objectives: As a result of the class, students will be able to: have some basic knowledge of the definition of international relations and the different approaches to studying international relations. identify and describe dominant topics and concepts related to international relations. obtain a comprehensive understanding of international relations. sharpen research and critical thinking skills. Thus, students should: know basic concepts to understand the topics in international relations. know existing theories to explain the phenomenon in which scholars in international relations are interested. be able to apply the existing theories to different contexts. "],["social-science-ir.html", "Topic 1 Social Science &amp; IR 1.1 Interaction between political units in world politics 1.2 Social science 1.3 Social science and International Relations", " Topic 1 Social Science &amp; IR 1.1 Interaction between political units in world politics Classically the interaction between countries. But its much more than that. International Relations, a subfield of political science, studies interactions among the various actors that participate in international politics. Politically, states are confronted with issues like disease, migration, and environmental degradation that governments cannot manage on their own: War, alliances Economically, states financial markets are tied together; the internationalization of production makes it more difficult for states to regulate their own economic policies and causes them to be more affected by international forces: Trade, investment, aid Globalization is the growing integration of the world in terms of politics, economics, and culture. Financial markets are tied together and states are experiencing cultural homogenization. IR also studies political phenomena beyond the scope of countries, such as financial crises, human rights, United Nations, WTO, Regional &amp; Global Events. 1.2 Social science For establishing scientific knowledge, we should answer two questions: On questions of fact: scientific facts should be empirical and reproducible. On question of theory: scientific knowledge must be explanatory and testable. 1.3 Social science and International Relations Political scientists develop theories to understand the causes of events that occur in international relations. Key theories are Realism and neorealism Liberalism and neoliberal institutionalism Constructivism These theories help us describe, explain, and predict. Suppose a theory has a following structure: X (cause) causes Y (outcome) under C (conditions). To evaluate the theory, we should describe what X, Y and C. When we know what X and C are, we can predict Y with the theory. When we know what Y is and the theory, we can explain what causes Y. Conditions Spatial: For example, U.S., Latin America, East Asia, or Africa Temporal: After the Cold War, during the Great Depression, under the Pandemic Other factors: The Effect of X on Y can be conditional on C. To assess the accuracy, relevancy, and potency of their theories, scholars of international relations rely on history, philosophy, and scientific method. Much of classical philosophy focuses on the state and its leadersthe basic building blocks of international relations. Hobbes: society can escape from the state of nature through a unitary state with centralized power. Rousseau: small communities, in which the general will can be attained, lead to the fulfillment of the individuals self-interests. Kant: a federation of sovereign republics bound by the rule of law is a means to peace. Philosophy helps us speculate on the normative (or moral) elements of political life. Normative questions are the should questions. However, scholars experienced several failure to explain global events, such as World Wars and ask a question if such normative theories are sufficient. Thus, the scientific method of behavioralism emerged, proposing that individuals, both alone and in groups, act in patterned ways. 1.3.1 Behaviorism 1.3.1.1 Description Behavioralism proposes that individuals, both alone and in groups, act in patterned ways, believing that generalizable patterns may be found. It suggests plausible hypotheses regarding those patterned actions, and empirically tests those hypotheses. 1.3.1.2 Significance fter introducing the Behavioralism, political scientists moved from the should questions to why questions. It led to paradigm shifts in terms of methods in IR, Political Science, and even Social Science. "],["the-historical-context-of-contemporary-international-relations.html", "Topic 2 The Historical Context of Contemporary International Relations 2.1 Remarkable Events", " Topic 2 The Historical Context of Contemporary International Relations Why do we care about history? It is because history explains the origins of key concepts in international relations such as sovereignty, the international state system, colonialism, and power distribution among states. Throughout modern history, four distinct changing movements have occurred: democratization, modernization, secularization, and globalization. Democratization: Many states in modern history have experienced regime transitions from authoritarian to democratic. Samuel Huntington, for example, refers to the three major regime transition movements as waves. Modernization: It encompasses various aspects of societal development, including education, economic growth, and human rights. Secularization: The political power of the church no longer trumps the political power of the states. After a 30-year war, kings were free of the Pope. Globalization: The worlds increasing integration in terms of politics, economics, and culture. Financial markets are intertwined, and states are culturally homogenizing. 2.1 Remarkable Events Thirty Years War (Westphalian system) "],["grand-theories.html", "Topic 3 Grand Theories", " Topic 3 Grand Theories "],["final-exam-pool.html", "Final Exam Pool Part I.

Fill-in-the-blank A personalist dictatorship is one in which the leader, although often supported by a party or the military, retains personal control of policy decisions and the selection of regime personnel. The dictators dilemma is that he relies on repression to stay in power, but this repression creates incentives for everyone to falsify their preferences so that the dictator never knows his true level of societal support. The selectorate is the set of people who can play a role in selecting the leader. The winning coalition includes those people whose support is necessary for the leader to stay in power. A strategic vote is a vote in which an individual votes in favor of a less preferred option because she believes doing so will ultimately produce a more preferred outcome. A sincere vote is a vote for an individuals most preferred option. An indifference curve is a set of points such that an individual is indifferent between any two points in the set.
