How to study Remember our course objectives: As a result of the class, students will be able to: have some basic knowledge of the definition of international relations and the different approaches to studying international relations. identify and describe dominant topics and concepts related to international relations. obtain a comprehensive understanding of international relations. sharpen research and critical thinking skills. Thus, students should: know basic concepts to understand the topics in international relations. know existing theories to explain the phenomenon in which scholars in international relations are interested. be able to apply the existing theories to different contexts. "],["social-science-ir.html", "Topic 1 Social Science &amp; IR 1.1 Interaction between political units in world politics 1.2 Social science 1.3 Social science and International Relations", " Topic 1 Social Science &amp; IR 1.1 Interaction between political units in world politics Classically the interaction between countries. But its much more than that. International Relations, a subfield of political science, studies interactions among the various actors that participate in international politics. Politically, states are confronted with issues like disease, migration, and environmental degradation that governments cannot manage on their own: War, alliances Economically, states financial markets are tied together; the internationalization of production makes it more difficult for states to regulate their own economic policies and causes them to be more affected by international forces: Trade, investment, aid Globalization is the growing integration of the world in terms of politics, economics, and culture. Financial markets are tied together and states are experiencing cultural homogenization. IR also studies political phenomena beyond the scope of countries, such as financial crises, human rights, United Nations, WTO, Regional &amp; Global Events. 1.2 Social science For establishing scientific knowledge, we should answer two questions: On questions of fact: scientific facts should be empirical and reproducible. On question of theory: scientific knowledge must be explanatory and testable. 1.3 Social science and International Relations Political scientists develop theories to understand the causes of events that occur in international relations. Key theories are Realism and neorealism Liberalism and neoliberal institutionalism Constructivism These theories help us describe, explain, and predict. Suppose a theory has a following structure: X (cause) causes Y (outcome) under C (conditions). To evaluate the theory, we should describe what X, Y and C. When we know what X and C are, we can predict Y with the theory. When we know what Y is and the theory, we can explain what causes Y. Conditions Spatial: For example, U.S., Latin America, East Asia, or Africa Temporal: After the Cold War, during the Great Depression, under the Pandemic Other factors: The Effect of X on Y can be conditional on C. To assess the accuracy, relevancy, and potency of their theories, scholars of international relations rely on history, philosophy, and scientific method. Much of classical philosophy focuses on the state and its leadersthe basic building blocks of international relations. Hobbes: society can escape from the state of nature through a unitary state with centralized power. Rousseau: small communities, in which the general will can be attained, lead to the fulfillment of the individuals self-interests. Kant: a federation of sovereign republics bound by the rule of law is a means to peace. Philosophy helps us speculate on the normative (or moral) elements of political life. Normative questions are the should questions. However, scholars experienced several failure to explain global events, such as World Wars and ask a question if such normative theories are sufficient. Thus, the scientific method of behavioralism emerged, proposing that individuals, both alone and in groups, act in patterned ways. 1.3.1 Behaviorism 1.3.1.1 Description Behavioralism proposes that individuals, both alone and in groups, act in patterned ways, believing that generalizable patterns may be found. It suggests plausible hypotheses regarding those patterned actions, and empirically tests those hypotheses. 1.3.1.2 Significance fter introducing the Behavioralism, political scientists moved from the should questions to why questions. It led to paradigm shifts in terms of methods in IR, Political Science, and even Social Science. "],["the-historical-context-of-contemporary-international-relations.html", "Topic 2 The Historical Context of Contemporary International Relations 2.1 Remarkable Events 2.2 Key Concepts", " Topic 2 The Historical Context of Contemporary International Relations Why do we care about history? It is because history explains the origins of key concepts in international relations such as sovereignty, the international state system, colonialism, and power distribution among states. Throughout modern history, four distinct changing movements have occurred: democratization, modernization, secularization, and globalization. Democratization: Many states in modern history have experienced regime transitions from authoritarian to democratic. Samuel Huntington, for example, refers to the three major regime transition movements as waves. Modernization: It encompasses various aspects of societal development, including education, economic growth, and human rights. Secularization: The political power of the church no longer trumps the political power of the states. After a 30-year war, kings were free of the Pope. Globalization: The worlds increasing integration in terms of politics, economics, and culture. Financial markets are intertwined, and states are culturally homogenizing. 2.1 Remarkable Events 2.1.1 Thirty Years War (Westphalian system) 2.1.1.1 Description A religious dispute between Catholics and Protestants. It began when Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II of Bohemia attempted to curtail the religious activities of his subjects, sparking rebellion among Protestants. 2.1.1.2 Significance Most international relations theorists locate the origins of the contemporary state system in Europe in 1648, the year the Treaties of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years War. These treaties marked the end of rule by religious authority in Europe and the emergence of secular authorities. With secular authority came the principle that has provided the foundation for contemporary international relations: the notion of the territorial integrity of states. 2.1.2 American and French revolutions (177385, 1789) 2.1.3 Napoleonic Wars (180315) 2.1.3.1 Description Napoleon led large, well-armed, and passionately motivated armies to conquer the entire Europe. 2.1.3.2 Significance In combination with nationalism, advanced system made it possible for the French to field larger, more mobile, and more reliable armies that could employ innovative tactics. 2.1.4 The Concert of Europe 2.1.4.1 Description General consensus among the Great Powers to maintain the European balance of power and the integrity of territorial boundaries. 2.1.4.2 Significance The concert of Europe made the balance of power be rule of thumb for the European countries for their foreign policy goals. 2.1.5 Solidification of Alliances and World War I Whereas in most of the nineteenth century, alliances had been flexible and fluid, by the later years, alliances became more rigid. The balance of power broke down due to these solidifications of alliances, resulting in World War I. 2.1.6 World War II Hitler and the Third Reich: Fascism as practiced by Hitler effectively mobilized the masses in support of the state, exalting the nation and race above the individual. It capitalized on the idea that war and conflict were noble activities from which ultimately superior civilizations would be formed. The rise of Mussolini and fascist Italy Brutality of the Axis powers toward noncombatants 2.1.7 The Cold War After World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union (USSR) emerged as two superpowers. The Cold War describes about 45 years of overall high-level tension and competition between the superpowers but no direct military conflict. The United States adopted a policy of containment, as opposed to a more aggressive rollback strategy. The USSR pushed favored an aggressive rollback strategy, which forces other countries to change their policies. 2.2 Key Concepts 2.2.1 Sovereignty 2.2.1.1 Description Independent legal authority over a population in a particular territory, based on the recognized right to self-determination. 2.2.1.2 Significance Sovereignty rests with those who have the ultimate right to make political decisions. 2.2.2 Balance of Power 2.2.2.1 Description States with relatively equal power offset concentrations of power to prevent the emergence of hegemonies or hegemonic blocks. 2.2.2.2 Significance When one state or coalition of states is much more powerful than its adversaries, asymmetrical war is relatively more likely. Due to BoP, states considered multipolar system is likely to lead stable international system. "],["grand-theories.html", "Topic 3 Grand Theories 3.1 Realism and Neo-realism 3.2 Liberalism and Neo-liberal Institutionalism 3.3 Constructivism 3.4 Key Concepts", " Topic 3 Grand Theories 3.1 Realism and Neo-realism A paradigm based on the premise that world politics is essentially and unchangeably a struggle among self-interested states for power and position under anarchy, with each competing state pursuing its ownnational interests. 3.1.1 Assumptions Key words: Anarchy, States, Survival (Security), National interests, Self-help, (Alliances) 3.1.2 Political Realism Hans Morgenthau Just as for Thucydides, Augustine, and Hobbes, international politics is best characterized as a struggle for power: international self-help system Power is the most important currency in international politics both to take from others and to prevent the inevitable effort by others to steal. Emphasized relative gains, security dilemma, power, and diplomacy. Criticism: Human nature is a constant, not a variable. It is almost impossible to observe innate conflict in men. 3.1.3 Structural (Neo-) Realism Kenneth Waltzs neorealism (or structural realism) proposes structural characteristics of the international system as main explanatory factors. System structure and the distribution of power, rather than the characteristics of states, determine outcomes. 3.1.3.1 Anarchy 3.1.3.2 Distribution of power (polarity): unipolar, bipolar, multipolar 3.1.3.2.1 Descripton The number of states  one(unipolar), two(bipolar), three(tripolar), or more(multipolar)  holding significant power in the international system. Unipolar, where one state in the system has sufficient power to defeat all the others combined against it. Bipolar, where most of the systems power is divided between two states or coalitions of states Multipolar, in which power is divided among three or more states or coalitions of states. 3.1.3.2.2 Significance It describes the nature of the international system at any given period of time. 3.1.4 Power Transition Theory Does not assume anarchic international system. PTT Focuses on differential growth rates and their effect on altering relative power between nations, resulting in new relationships among nations or competing groups and the formation of new political and economic entities. 3.2 Liberalism and Neo-liberal Institutionalism A paradigm predicated on the hope that the application of reason and universal ethics to international relations can lead to a more orderly, just, and cooperative world. 3.2.1 Assumptions Do not assume states as unitary actors (state actor &lt; non-state actor) and perfectly rational actors. Also, (classical) liberalism reject the impact of anarchic international system. Emphasizes interdependence and cooperation among transnational actors (states + non-states) 3.2.2 Liberal idealism (Classical liberalism) Advocates creating global institutions to contain the raw struggle for power between self-serving, mutually suspicious states. 3.2.2.1 Collective Security. A security regime agreed to by the great powers that sets rules for keeping peace, guided by the principle that an act of aggression by any state will be met by a collective response from the rest. 3.2.2.2 Limitations Classical liberalism overlooked the influence of international anarchic system. Also, it appealed to the human communitys moral spirit to solve the problem of cooperation. Furthermore, it does not value the role of the state (state &lt; individuals). Classical liberalism does not have clear answer for security issue. 3.2.3 Democratic Peace Theory Democratic political cultures and system avoid lethal force as a means of settling disagreements. Conflict-resolution practices used at home (domestically) can also be used when dealing with international disputes. eaders socialized within democratic cultures share a common outlook, applying democratic norms (based on tolerance, compromise, and civil liberties) to regulate international competition. Diplomacy provides a means for achieving mutually acceptable solutions to a common problem, and enables leaders to negotiate and compromise in a peaceful manner. Diplomacy: Communication and negotiation between global actors that is not dependent upon the use of force and seeks a cooperative solution 3.2.4 Neoliberal Institutionalism The new liberal theoretical perspective that accounts for the way international institutions promote global change, cooperation, peace, and prosperity through collective programs for reforms. Neoliberal institutionalism share an interest in probing the conditions under which the convergent and overlapping interests among otherwise independent transnational actors may result in cooperation. 3.2.4.1 Assumptions Cooperation emerges not as a result of humanitys desire for positive change but as a result of self-interest. States are unitary rational actors that pursue self-interest. Despite the existence of anarchy, interstate cooperation can arise as states focus on absolute gains. Neoliberal institutionalists arrive at the same prediction that other liberals docooperationbut their explanation for why cooperation occurs is different. International institutions and reciprocity foster cooperation. Should read Keohane and Martin (1995)! 3.3 Constructivism A paradigm based on the premise that world politics is a function of the ways that states construct and then accept images of reality and later respond to the meanings given to power politics. State behavior is shaped by elite beliefs, identities, and social norms. Individuals forge, shape, and change culture through ideas and practices. Interests at all levels are socially constructed via constant interaction. National interests are ever-changing and the result of social identities of state actors. People and their discourse bring meaning to material structures. International organizations can socialize states and individuals to norms. 3.3.1 Wendt (1991) The meaning of anarchy can be either conflictual or cooperative, depending on underlying shared knowledge (e.g. anarchy among allies vs. anarchy among enemies). 3.4 Key Concepts 3.4.1 Security Dilemma 3.4.1.1 Description The situation that states face when they arm to defend themselves and, in the process, threaten other states. 3.4.1.2 Significance The most important source of conflict between states. 3.4.2 Institutions 3.4.2.1 Description The formal and informal rules that organize social, political and economic relations. Set of implicit or explicit principles, norms, rules, and decision-making procedures around which actors expectations converge. 3.4.2.2 Significance A key structure that makes states cooperate even under the anarchic system and uncertainties. 3.4.3 Complex interdependence 3.4.3.1 Description States are connected through .multiple channels. 3.4.3.2 Significance As security is not the only concern, when the complex interdependence increases, it is more likely to decline in the use of military force.

Understanding where facts are coming from helps us to sort out facts and the origins of causes in highly complex problems (external vs. internal; systemic, domestic, and individual level). Dividing the analysis of international politics into levels of analysis helps orient our questions and suggests the appropriate type of evidence to explore. We can approach the study of international relations not only by looking through the lenses of the various perspectives but also by highlighting explanatory factors that occur at the different levels of analysis. 4.1 Different Levels International system level: focuses on systemic characteristics such as power distribution State level] focuses on domestic factors and internal characteristics of states Organizational level: focuses on particular groups or organizations such as firms or interest groups and their choices. Individual level: focuses on individuals and their perceptions, choices, activities, etc. 4.2 Macro level: Holism Macro level focuses on systems as a whole rather than individually. It considers that the whole is more than a sum of its parts. However, it has a possible ecological fallacy. 4.3 Micro level: Reductionism Micro level can be called methodological individualism (McGaw and Watson, 1976), which argues that the whole is nothing more than a sum of its part. However, micro level analysis also have a possible fallacy of composition. 4.4 Which International Polarity Is More Stable? 4.4.1 Kenneth Waltz: bipolarity is more stable. Disruptive behavior is immediately evident. Two sides can moderate each others use of violence. They can absorb potentially destabilizing changes. Each focuses its activity on just the other. 4.4.2 Some theorists believe that multipolarity can be quite stable. The success of multipolarity depends on whether rules are followed. When an essential actor ignores the understood rules, the system may become unstable. There are more interactions and less opportunity to dwell on one state. There is a greater flexibility of responses to threats. Shifting alliances allow for flexibility and enhance a balance of power. Wars are limited in nature and designed to preserve a balance of power. 4.4.3 Hegemonic stability theorists argue that unipolarity is more stable. The hegemon pays the price of enforcing norms to ensure stability. They create rules and institutions in various issue areas to help guide states behavior. Hegemons must be able and willing to lead the international community for the system to be stable. When the hegemon declines, so does system stability. 4.5 Neoliberal institutionalists think the problem is not polarity but institutions. The international system is anarchic, but cooperation may emerge through institutions. Institutions may be created from self-interest. Repeated interactions provide the motivation for states to create international institutions. Institutions can moderate state behavior and provide a framework for coordination and cooperation. 4.6 Constructivists think international outcomes cannot be explained by structures alone. Power and anarchy matter, but their meanings change over time. Anarchy is what states make of it. International structures are socially constructed; neither sovereignty nor balance of power objectively exist. We can understand international order only by looking at states ideas, identities, and interactions. "],["the-tools-of-statecraft.html", "Topic 5 The Tools of Statecraft 5.1 The State, Defined 5.2 State Power 5.3 Hard Power versus Soft Power 5.4 Statecraft", " Topic 5 The Tools of Statecraft 5.1 The State, Defined Stable population An effective government to which the population has allegiance Recognized diplomatically by other states 5.2 State Power Power is the ability to influence behavior and control outcomes. States ability to get others to do something that they would not otherwise do. All theoretical perspectives acknowledge the importance of power, but each pays attention to different types of power. Realists and liberals conceptualize power in materialist terms. Constructivists emphasize nonmaterialist sources. 5.3 Hard Power versus Soft Power 5.3.1 Hard power It entails using various sources of power to coerce others. States using various sources of power (economic or military) to coerce other states into adopting actions in its interests. 5.3.2 Soft power It entails trying to persuade others. The power to attract states to change their behavior rather than having to coerce them into doing so; power is based on the legitimacy of the states values or its policies. 5.3.3 Smart power Successful power projection often involves a combination of both hard and soft power. 5.4 Statecraft 5.4.1 Diplomacy 5.4.1.1 Track One diplomacy 5.4.1.1.1 Traditional diplomacy Influencing the behavior of others by negotiating and bargaining Taking a specific action or refraining from action Appealing to the foreign public for support of a position 5.4.1.1.2 Public diplomacy Involves strategically targeting foreign publics and elites with informational, cultural, and educational programming. Important use of a countrys soft power 5.4.1.2 Track Two diplomacy Nofficial overtures by private individuals or groups from outside governments to try and resolve an ongoing international crisis or civil war. The idea behind this type of diplomacy is that the absence of government officials who are supposed to defend their governments policy positions might lead to more open discussions with a greater likelihood of breaking through difficult impasses. 5.4.2 Economic statecraft 5.4.2.1 Positive sanctions Carrots entice states to move in the desired direction, assuming that positive incentives will lead the target state to change its behavior. Granting trading privileges Permitting trading in sensitive products Giving corporations investment guarantees or tax breaks 5.4.2.2 Nagative sanctions Threaten or take actions that punish the state for an undesirable move. Freeze a target states assets. Prohibit certain financial transactions. Arms embargoes Comprehensive sanctions Allowing importation of goods at best rates 5.4.2.3 Smart sanctions Targeted sanctions focusing on specific individuals and groups to avoid the high humanitarian costs of general sanctions. Limited sanctions targeted to hurt or support specific groups; used to avoid the humanitarian costs of general sanctions. Smart sanctions are seen as a cheaper option than general sanctions. Sometimes, sanctions can have unintended negative consequences. 5.4.3 Force 5.4.3.1 Compellence Threat of the use of force to get a target state to do something or undo an act already undertaken. 5.4.3.2 Deterrence Threatening or actually punishing a target state if it takes an undesired action "],["war-and-conflict.html", "Topic 6 War and Conflict 6.1 Different types of war 6.2 What is War? 6.3 Why Does the War Occur? 6.4 Rationalist Explanation of War 6.5 Preventing Wars 6.6 Why do states obtain nuclear weapons? 6.7 What Makes Civil Wars? 6.8 Outcomes of Civil Wars", " Topic 6 War and Conflict 6.1 Different types of war War Conventional Unconventional Guerilla Warfare Terrorism WMD 6.2 What is War?

External determinants Domestic determinants Prestige Hymans (2006) 6.7 What Makes Civil Wars? Population (Sambanis 2001, Anyanwu 2002, Collier and Hoeffler 2002a, 2004b, Elbadawi and Sambanis 2002) Diversity at medium levels (ethnic, linguistic and religious) (Ellingsen 2002, Caprioli 2003 and 2005) Geography (proximity to other states at war) (Sambanis, 2006, Gleditsch, 2007, Salehyan, 2006) Size of country, mounains (Buhang, 2006) Oil exporters (Krause and Suzuki, 2005, Buhang, 2006, Ross 2006) 6.8 Outcomes of Civil Wars State capacity matters but we dont know how. More capacity = more probability of victory (Bapat 2005, Mason et al, 1999, Brandt et al, 2008) More capacity = less likely victory (Balch-Lindsey et all, 2008, DeRouen and Sobek, 2004) Foreign Interventions matter. Foreign assistance to insurgents is one of the strong predictors of their success (Svensson, 2007, Balch-Lindsay et all, 2008, Lyall and Wilson, 2009, Thyne, 2009, Lyall, 2010b). The biggest gap we have identified in our collective understanding of the factors affecting who wins Civil Wars is the lack of comprehensive conclusions connecting COIN strategies on the ground with conflict outcomes (Stojeck and Sullivan, 2013) "],["midterm-exam-pool.html", "Midterm Exam Pool Part I.
